# Here you can specify the lists of limits for the number of ships of some types that country can own
# and potentially the lists of limits for the number of building of some type (not implemented yet)

# Note for overwriting: ownership_limits are extendable/additive. So if you make a second "default" and
# add a single ship_of_size_limit inside it, it will apply both the limits described here, and the one
# that you specified.
# To do a full overwrite, you need to overwrite 00_ownership_limits.txt instead.

# Example:
# name_of_ownership_limit = {
#	ship_of_size_limits = {
#		# the list of keys to ship_of_size_limits database
#	}
# 	building_of_type_limit = {
#		# not implemented yet
#	}
# }

default = {
	ship_of_size_limits = {
		RG_gray_juggernaut_ships_limit
	}
}
